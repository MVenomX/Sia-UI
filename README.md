# Sia UI

This is the user interface for [Sia](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia), it is a desktop application based off the
[atom-shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell) framework.

## Running the application

There are prebuilt binaries [nowhere](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia-UI/issues/7)

If you're developing the application and want to run without building...

1. Download and install atom-shell using pre-built binaries [here](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/releases)
2. Run `/path/to/atom /path/to/Sia-UI`
